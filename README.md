Uhm, sort of trigger warnings yea, but not really..?

# I sort of don't know how to explain this in a good order.. Yet I guess I'll start with some social problems I have.

For some reason, if i'm randomly ontab or rather on online status, i'm most likely looking to sit with someone or some shit, why won't I go to the people with c+h in their name? Since I lowkey get scared to approuach them, since I have that aching feeling in the back of my mind that i'm gonna get pushed away or something, even if it's freely, I just get rather overwhelemed by myself trying to approuach, like- fingers hovering right over the keys, and I then just freeze up, unable to move.. I don't know if that's very normal... yet I just have bad fears to approauch people randomly, even if I really want to, which is so... weird.? I don't know why it happens to me or I feel that way.. 

# For friends to read !

So to some of you guys, sorry if I don't really approuach you or anything. Or interact with you, for some reason-  I just fear approauching, I swear that I consider it so much, and build up courage, and that shit never works. Yet i'm trying for it to not be like this. I swear.

# Extra 

Writing out my problems helps me feel better.. In a way, but uhm look, I might just have horrible anixety or some shit... Yet sorry if I come off dry or something, i'm usually just drained or something.. eueuehue I forgot what I was gonna type, give me a moment ... ok.  Yet basically it's hard for my thoughts to focus on one thing without me overthinking that, and my bad if I come off as very apolgotic when theres nothing wrong, I just have some habits of doing things or saying things... And sorry if I randomly fall silent during a converstation or something, this isn't my main readme.. I just wanna explain some things about me...

# extra extra

Uh, I just wanted to say sorry again if I act a certain way, its not really normal, can someone tell me good ways to like calm down minus deep breaths, it doesn't really help, thank you ! . /
